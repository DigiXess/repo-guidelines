# Security Guidelines

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly. Contact the security team at `security@example.com` with details of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

## Secure Development Practices

- Always use secure coding practices and avoid common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Use static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential security issues.

## Access Control

- Restrict access to sensitive branches like `main` and `staging`.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit permissions.

## Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys and passwords in the codebase.

## Incident Response

- Have an incident response plan in place.
- Document and communicate the steps to be taken in case of a security breach.

## Dependencies

- Regularly audit third-party libraries and frameworks for vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like `npm audit` or `pip-audit` to identify and fix issues.
