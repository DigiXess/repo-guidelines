# Document Repository Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the graphics assets such as logo, images, icons,vectors,videos etc. repository for consistent and collaborative development across all DigiXess projects.

Follow the below guidelines:

- Commit frequently: Make small, logical commits to track changes effectively.
- Write clear commit messages: Use descriptive messages to explain what changes were made and why.
- Follow:
    - [Basic Repository Branch Structure][basic-repo-branch-structure]
    - [Branch and Merge Strategy][branch-merge-strategy]
    - [Commit Message Conventions][commit-message-conventions]
    - [Tag Versioning Guidelines][tag-versioning-guidelines]
- Always branch instead of fork.
- Don't commit sensitive information: Avoid committing passwords, API keys, or other sensitive data.
- Avoid force pushing or rewriting history on shared branches.
- Don't commit large files: Use Git LFS or other solutions for large files instead.
- Set up branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes and require pull requests for changes. See [Protecting `main` Branch](/common/protecting-main-branch.md "Protecting `main`") for more details.
