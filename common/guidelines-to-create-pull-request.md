1. Provide a clear and concise title for the PR that summarizes the changes made.
1. Include a detailed description of the changes made, including any relevant context or background information.
1. Assign reviewers to your PR to ensure it is reviewed by the appropriate team members.
1. Respond to any feedback or comments from reviewers in a timely manner.
1. If changes are requested, make the necessary updates in your branch and push the changes to the remote repository.
