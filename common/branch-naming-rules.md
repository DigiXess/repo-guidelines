# Branch Name Conventions

Follow the rules below for creating branch names:

- Use lowercase and hyphens (`-`) only. No spaces or special characters.
- Use the prefix that matches the purpose of the branch. E.g.: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `staging/`, `hotfix/`, etc. See the [Basic Repository Branch Structure](/code/basic-repo-branch-structure.md) for more details.
- Don't use  GIT Reserved names like `HEAD`, `FETCH_HEAD`, `ORIG_HEAD`, etc.
- Keep the branch name short and limit to 128 characters.
- Link branches to issues or tickets, or issue numbers, etc. E.g.: `bugfix/issue-245`.
- Avoid using special characters or spaces in branch names.
