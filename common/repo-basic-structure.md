# Basic Repository Structure

This document outlines the basic structure of a repository, including essential files and directories to include for effective collaboration. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various types of projects, ensuring that all necessary components are included for a successful development process.


## Files and Directories

The following files and directories are essential for all repositories to ensure proper documentation, collaboration, and version control:

| Filename             | Purpose                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`          | Main documentation — project overview, setup instructions, usage, etc.    |
| `LICENSE.md`         | Licensing terms (MIT, GPL, etc.) so others know how they can use it        |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`    | Guidelines for contributing (how to fork, create PRs, follow code style)   |
| `CHANGELOG.md` OR `changelog/` | Track major changes, fixes, and feature additions across versions          |
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Optional — rules for respectful collaboration                              |

| `AUTHORS.md`         | List of authors or maintainers of the project                             |
| `docs/`              | Directory for additional documentation (API docs, tutorials, guides, etc.)|
| `.gitignore`         | Files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., build artifacts, logs)  |
